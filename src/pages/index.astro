		<p class="mb-4">
			<i
				>Every few years, a technology emerges that changes everything. Zero Knowledge Cryptography
				is one of those technologies...</i
			>

			<br />
			<br />

			Our starting point is to take the internet of today, and imagine it’s diametrical opposite…
			because the internet of today is convoluted, slow, and degraded, we should give our ideal
			internet beauty, speed, and power. The internet of today is exposed and crowded, therefore,
			our internet should be individual and proud. The internet of today wants to enslave us,
			therefore our internet will shatter it’s shackles, and declare uncompromising freedom!
			<br />
			<br />

			Zero Knowledge Cryptography is no mere academic exercise or business venture, it is our path
			to liberation. However, without immediate action our future will remain out of reach. Forever
			over the horizon. Our path is clear and we will build our ideal internet in three stages.

			<br /><br />
			1) <b>Collaborate</b>: engage in joint research. <br />
			2) <b>Design</b>: create advanced algorithms. <br />
			3) <b>Implement</b>: develop cutting-edge protocols. <br />

			<br />
			Only through mastery of the algorithmic and mathematic primitives which power modern cryptography,
			and the constant design and implementation of revolutionary protocols, can we reach our greatest
			future.
