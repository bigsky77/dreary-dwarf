# Low-Degree Test, Vanishing Conditions, and Consistency Check

## Low-Degree Test

### Introduction

The **Low-Degree Test** is a probabilistic algorithm used to verify whether a given function $f: F^n \rightarrow F$, where $F$ is a finite field, is close to a polynomial of total degree at most $d$.

### Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
Input:
  - Function f: F^n → F
  - Degree bound d (a non-negative integer)
  - Error parameter ε ∈ (0, 1)

Output:
  - "Accept" or "Reject"

1. Determine the number of repetitions N to achieve the desired error probability ε.
   - Typically, N = ⎡(1/ε)⎤.

2. For iteration = 1 to N do:
   a. Randomly select a line ℓ in F^n:
      i. Choose a random point a ∈ F^n.
      ii. Choose a random non-zero direction vector v ∈ F^n.
      iii. Define the line ℓ = { a + t * v | t ∈ F }.

   b. Sample f along ℓ:
      i. Choose k ≥ d + 2 distinct elements { t_1, t_2, ..., t_k } from F.
         - Using more than d + 1 points allows for consistency checks.
      ii. For each t_i, compute y_i = f(a + t_i * v).

   c. Perform the univariate low-degree test:
      i. Interpolate a univariate polynomial p(t) of degree ≤ d using points { (t_i, y_i) }.
         - Use polynomial interpolation methods (e.g., Lagrange interpolation).
      ii. Verify that for all sampled points, y_i = p(t_i).
      iii. Optionally, evaluate additional random points t' ∈ F:
         - Check that f(a + t' * v) = p(t').

   d. If interpolation fails or any verification check does not hold, output "Reject" and halt.

3. If all iterations pass without rejection, output "Accept".
```

### Context and Usefulness

- **Random Line Restrictions**: By examining $f$ along random lines, the multivariate function is reduced to a univariate function, simplifying analysis while retaining probabilistic guarantees.

- **Univariate Polynomial Verification**: Testing whether $f$ restricted to $ℓ$ behaves like a degree-≤d polynomial provides evidence that $f$ globally is close to a low-degree polynomial.

- **Error Probability**: The number of repetitions N controls the soundness of the test. Each iteration independently increases confidence in the result.

- **Applications**:
  - **Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs)**: The low-degree test is crucial for verifying that encoded proofs behave correctly, enabling efficient proof checking.
  - **Error-Correcting Codes**: In Reed-Muller codes, codewords correspond to evaluations of low-degree polynomials. The test checks for codeword validity.
  - **Complexity Theory**: Aids in establishing hardness of approximation results by verifying properties of functions used in reductions.

## Vanishing Conditions

### Introduction

**Vanishing Conditions** involve verifying that a polynomial $f: F^n \rightarrow F$ vanishes on a specific algebraic set $Z \subseteq F^n$. This is important in algebraic geometry, coding theory, and cryptography.

### Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
Input:
  - Function f: F^n → F
  - Vanishing ideal generators { h_1, h_2, ..., h_m } ⊆ F[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]
    - Each h_j satisfies h_j(z) = 0 for all z ∈ Z
  - Error parameter δ ∈ (0, 1)

Output:
  - "Accept" or "Reject"

1. Determine the number of iterations M to achieve the desired error probability δ.
   - Typically, M = ⎡(1/δ)⎤.

2. For iteration = 1 to M do:
   a. Randomly select a polynomial h from { h_1, h_2, ..., h_m }.

   b. Randomly select a point x ∈ F^n.

   c. Evaluate the vanishing condition at x:
      i. Compute s = h(x).
      ii. Compute y = f(x).
      iii. Check if s * y = 0:
         - If s * y ≠ 0, output "Reject" and halt.

3. If all iterations pass without rejection, output "Accept".
```

### Context and Usefulness

- **Algebraic Sets and Vanishing Ideals**: The vanishing ideal $I(Z)$ consists of all polynomials that vanish on $Z$. Testing whether $f \cdot h = 0$ for $h \in I(Z)$ checks if $f$ vanishes on $Z$.

- **Probabilistic Verification**: Random sampling provides an efficient way to test vanishing conditions without exhaustively checking all points in $Z$.

- **Applications**:
  - **Error-Correcting Codes**: Ensures codewords meet specific structural properties, essential for the functioning of codes like Reed-Solomon.
  - **Cryptography**: Used in zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable secret sharing to enforce algebraic relationships without revealing underlying secrets.
  - **Computational Algebra**: Fundamental in solving polynomial equations and studying algebraic varieties.

## Consistency Check

### Introduction

A **Consistency Check** is a probabilistic method used to verify that multiple functions agree on their overlapping domains according to a specified relation. This is vital in distributed systems, multi-prover proof systems, and data integrity verification.

### Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
Input:
  - Collection of functions { f_i }: D_i → F, for i = 1 to m
    - Each D_i ⊆ F^n
  - Consistency relation R ⊆ F × F
  - Error parameter η ∈ (0, 1)

Output:
  - "Accept" or "Reject"

1. Identify pairs with overlapping domains:
   - For each pair (i, j), determine the overlap O_{ij} = D_i ∩ D_j.
   - Collect all pairs where O_{ij} ≠ ∅.

2. Determine the number of iterations K to achieve the desired error probability η.
   - Typically, K = ⎡(1/η)⎤.

3. For iteration = 1 to K do:
   a. Randomly select a pair (i, j) with O_{ij} ≠ ∅.

   b. Randomly select a point x ∈ O_{ij}.

   c. Evaluate the functions at x:
      i. Compute y_i = f_i(x).
      ii. Compute y_j = f_j(x).

   d. Check consistency:
      i. Verify that (y_i, y_j) ∈ R.
         - If not, output "Reject" and halt.

4. If all iterations pass without rejection, output "Accept".
```

### Context and Usefulness

- **Overlap Verification**: Ensures that functions agree where they are both defined, according to the relation $R$.

- **Probabilistic Testing**: Randomly sampling overlaps provides an efficient method to detect inconsistencies.

- **Applications**:
  - **Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs)**: Validates that different parts of a proof are consistent, crucial for the correctness of the verification process.
  - **Distributed Systems**: Checks that replicated data is consistent across different nodes or services.
  - **Error Detection and Fault Tolerance**: Identifies discrepancies due to errors or malicious tampering in systems where data integrity is critical.
