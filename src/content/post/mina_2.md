## Arithmetic Circuits: Gates and Constraints

At the core of zk-SNARKs, including the math powering Mina, is a powerful concept called arithmetization.  The basic idea is that we can transform program into arithmetic circuits which can then be represented as low-degree polynomials. These circuits represent computations as a network of interconnected gates, where each gate performs simple arithmetic operations. The correctness of the computation is enforced through a system of constraints that the prover must satisfy to generate a valid proof.

Here you can see an extremely simple circuit in action.

**Explanation:**

1. **Add Gate:** Takes inputs \( x \) and \( y \) and outputs \( x + y \).
2. **Mul Gate:** Takes the output of the Add gate (\( x + y \)) and input \( w \), computing \( (x + y) * w \).

Mina uses a popular form of arithmetization called Plonkish.  In this note, we will do a high-level overview of basic gates and then do a deep dive into the Plonkish arithmetization used in Kimchi.  This will set us up to think about the core cryptographic protocol at a much deeper level.

## **2. Introduction to Basic Gates**
To enforce the correctness of computations within zk-SNARKs, each gate in the arithmetic circuit is associated with specific **constraints**. These constraints are algebraic equations that must hold true for the computation to be considered valid.

### **2.1. Addition Gate**
**Operation:** $z = x + y$ 

**Constraint Equation:**
$z - x - y = 0$

**Intuition:** This equation ensures that the output $z$ is exactly the sum of inputs $x$ and $y$.

### **2.2. Multiplication Gate**
**Operation:** $z = x \times y$
**Constraint Equation:**
$z - x \cdot y = 0$
**Intuition:** This equation ensures that the output $z$ is exactly the product of inputs $x$ and $y$.

### **2.3. General Gate Constraint**
In a more generalized setting, a gate can enforce a linear combination of inputs and outputs. For example:
$a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z + c = 0$
Where $a_1, a_2, a_3$ are coefficients, and $c$ is a constant term.

## **3. Constraint Systems**

A **constraint system** translates the computational logic of an arithmetic circuit into a set of algebraic equations that must be satisfied for the computation to be valid. In the context of arithmetization within zk-SNARKs, these constraints are often represented using matrices, enabling efficient mathematical manipulation and proof generation.

### **3.a. Arithmetization Using Matrices**

**Arithmetization** involves converting logical computations into algebraic forms. Representing constraints as matrices facilitates leveraging linear algebra techniques for efficient computation and verification. Let's explore how this abstraction is introduced and utilized.

#### **3.a.1. Matrix Representation of Constraints**

Consider an arithmetic circuit with multiple gates, each enforcing specific constraints. These constraints can be organized into matrices to systematically represent the relationships between variables and operations.

- **Variables Vector ($\mathbf{v}$):** A vector containing all the variables in the circuit, including inputs, outputs, and intermediate values.

  $\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
  v_1 \\
  v_2 \\
  \vdots \\
  v_n
  \end{bmatrix}$

- **Constraint Matrix ($\mathbf{A}$):** A matrix where each row represents a constraint equation, and each column corresponds to a variable.

  $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}$

  Here, $\mathbf{A}$ is an $m \times n$ matrix (with $m$ constraints and $n$ variables), and $\mathbf{b}$ is a vector representing the constants in each constraint equation.

#### **3.a.2. Example: Matrix Formulation**

Suppose we have a simple constraint system:

$\begin{cases}
v_1 + v_2 = v_3 \\
v_3 \times v_4 = v_5
\end{cases}$

To represent this system using matrices:

1. **Linearize the Constraints:**

   The first equation is linear, but the second is quadratic. To handle non-linear constraints, zk-SNARKs typically linearize them using auxiliary variables or polynomial representations. For simplicity, let's assume all constraints can be linearized.

2. **Define the Constraint Matrix ($\mathbf{A}$) and Constants Vector ($\mathbf{b}$):**

   $\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & -v_4 & -1
   \end{bmatrix}, \quad
   \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 \\
   0
   \end{bmatrix}$

   Here, each row of $\mathbf{A}$ corresponds to a constraint equation, ensuring that $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.

#### **3.a.3. Importance of Matrix Representation**

- **Scalability:** Efficiently handles large numbers of constraints and variables.
- **Linear Algebra Techniques:** Facilitates the use of polynomial commitments and evaluations.
- **Optimization:** Enables optimizations in proof generation and verification by exploiting matrix sparsity and structure.

### **3.c. Transitioning from Gates to Constraint Systems**

Understanding how individual gates translate into a global constraint system is crucial. Let's explore this transition with a high-level diagram and step-by-step explanation.

#### **3.c.1. Step-by-Step Transition**

1. **Define Gates:**

   - **Gate 1:** Logical AND to compute $s_1 = x \land x_2$
   - **Gate 2:** Multiplication to compute $s_2 = x_3 \times x_2$
   - **Gate 3:** Logical OR to compute $z = s_1 \lor s_2$

2. **Translate Each Gate to Constraints:**

   - **Gate 1 Constraint:**
     
     $s_1 - x \times x_2 = 0$

   - **Gate 2 Constraint:**
     
     $s_2 - x_3 \times x_2 = 0$

   - **Gate 3 Constraint:**
     
     $z - s_1 - s_2 + s_1 \times s_2 = 0$

3. **Assemble Constraints into a System:**

   Combine all constraints into a matrix form:

   $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$

   Where $\mathbf{v}$ includes all variables involved.

4. **Matrix Representation:**

   The constraint matrix $\mathbf{A}$ systematically encodes the relationships imposed by each gate, ensuring that the entire computation adheres to the intended logic.

#### **3.c.2. Visual Illustration: Gates to Constraints**

To further clarify the transition, consider the following diagram illustrating how individual gate constraints contribute to the overall constraint system.

```ascii
+---------+        +---------+        +---------+
| Gate 1  |        | Gate 2  |        | Gate 3  |

+---------+        +---------+        +---------+
     |                  |                  |
     v                  v                  v
Constraint 1       Constraint 2       Constraint 3
     |                  |                  |
     +---------+--------+---------+--------+
               |                   |
         Constraint System Matrix
               |
            [ A ] Â· [v] = 0
```

**Explanation:**

- **Gates:** Represent the logical and arithmetic operations.
- **Constraints:** Algebraic equations derived from each gate's operation.
- **Constraint System Matrix ($\mathbf{A}$):** Aggregates all constraints into a linear algebraic form, facilitating efficient proof construction and verification.

### **3.d. Mathematical Formulation and Intuition**

To solidify understanding, let's formalize the constraint system using matrix notation and explore the mathematical intuition behind it.

#### **3.d.1. Polynomial Representation**

In zk-SNARKs, constraints are often represented as polynomials evaluated over a finite field. Each gate's constraints contribute to a global polynomial that must evaluate to zero across the entire domain.

- **Gate Constraints:**

  For each gate $i$:

  $C_i(X) = S_{+}(X) \cdot (Z_i(X) - L_i(X) - R_i(X)) + S_{\times}(X) \cdot (Z_i(X) - L_i(X) \cdot R_i(X))$

  Where:
  
  - $S_{+}(X)$ and $S_{\times}(X)$ are selector polynomials determining the gate type.
  - $L_i(X)$, $R_i(X)$, and $Z_i(X)$ are polynomials representing the left input, right input, and output of gate $i$.

- **Global Constraint Polynomial:**

  $C(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} C_i(X) = 0 \quad \forall X \in \text{Domain}$

#### **3.d.2. Matrix Representation Revisited**

The polynomial constraints can be represented in matrix form for computational efficiency:

$\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$

Where:
- $\mathbf{A}$ encodes the coefficients from all constraints.
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the vector of variable assignments (including intermediate variables).

#### **3.d.3. Intuition Behind Matrix-Based Constraint Systems**

- **Linearization of Constraints:** By organizing constraints into a matrix, complex computations are transformed into linear algebra problems, which are well-understood and efficiently solvable.
- **Scalability:** Matrix operations scale gracefully with the size of the computation, allowing zk-SNARKs to handle large circuits.
- **Polynomial Commitment:** Leveraging matrices aligns with polynomial commitment schemes used in zk-SNARKs, facilitating secure and efficient proof generation.
